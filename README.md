## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework - For style
- [Swiper](https://styled-components.com/) - Modern touch slider - For the carrousel slider
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Framer Motion is a simple yet powerful motion library for React - For the movie information modal

### What I learned

At the beginning of this project I had several doubts. I figured out how to divide each segment with components but I wasn't sure how the combination of all of them was going to turn out.

Even so, little by little, I was learning about the inner workings of React, how to implement a router and have different routes, map the information in case in the future I decide to change the API and the reason for the various react hooks, the context and custom hooks.

In the end, I managed to develop the application completely.

### Continued development

Having achieved my goal, I will continue to expand my knowledge of both frontend and backend.

With the basics more solid and with some backend knowledge with node.js, my next goal is to develop an application using the MERN stack.
